In this lab I learned more about how servers work when using the TCP protocol.
The programs need to create sockets similar to when using UDP, but when they want to send data they need to 
bind, listen, and accept on the server side to receive connections from clients.
Clients need to create a socket, then use connect to be able to send data to and from a server.

File transfer can be done by opening a file on the server end, reading out lines from the file, then writing it to the socket to the client,
and then writing the lines received by reading on the socket and writing the lines to a file and saving it.
