In this lab we learned how to look at traffic on a network.

tcpdump
1) The packets are coming from co2048-17.ece.iastate.edu(192.168.254.17)

2) The option to view each packet in hex and ASCII is -X

3) The gateway filter can also be used with tcpdump

tcptrace
4) a) There are 24 TCP connections, only 9 are visible on the tcptrace page
	of those 9, all of them had a source of co2048-10.ece.iastate.edu(127.0.0.1).
	The connected on ports 57600, 53793, 57602, 57603, 57604, 57605, 57606, 45767, and 45768.
	The destinations were 209.56.124.25:emwavemsg, 119.145.14.135:emwavemsg and 8.37.235.27:emwavemsg.
b) The connections lasted for anywhere from 5.5seconds, 11.5seconds, or 12.5seconds on average.
c) In each case, 142, 5, 98, 53, 109, 125, 49, 4, and 7 packets were sent.

d) The avg owin to each server is 43 bytes, 1 bytes, 55 bytes, 61 bytes, 44 bytes, 34 bytes, 90 bytes, 1 bytes, and 55 bytes.
	The wavg owin to each server is 25 bytes, 0 bytes, 1 bytes, 1 bytes, 10 bytes, 18 bytes, 1 bytes, 0 bytes, and 1 bytes.

5)

Wireshark
6) a) Each ICMP packet contains about 98 bytes of data.
b) The hex values in the data feild are the same for each packet except for the same few feilds that change with each packet.
c) The time between each ping request packet looks to be about 1 second.
d) The sender was not exploiting any super user permissions since the value between each ping was left at the default.

7) a) Some other protocols besides TCP are ARP, DNS, and NFS.
b) TCP packets can be much larger, while some are only about 300 bytes or less, a large amount are upwards of a few thousand bytes in size.
UDP packets tend to only be about a few hundred bytes in size and not ever above 400 bytes.
The UDP headers are 40 bytes in size while the TCP headers are 32 bytes in size.
c) My two most common ranges of packet lengths are 1280-2559 and 40-79.

8) a)traceroute sends UDP and TCP packets
b) tcptraceroute sends only TCP packets

9) telnet command not found
