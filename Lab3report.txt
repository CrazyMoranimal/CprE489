Increasing the loss rate decreases the video quality because less data is getting to the destination and therefore less of the video can be displayed.

While TCP would help decrease loss rate since the protocol would allow for re-transmission of loss packets,
the result would be an increase in transmission time when packets need to be re-transmitted.

I would not use this for multimedia communication if the desire is to stream the
media in realtime and not worry about delay.
TCP would also require more overhead to set up the connection and stream data resulting in increased network load.

To run my program, you must compile it using gcc then pass in as command line arguments the source IP,
the source port, the destination IP, the destination port, and the loss rate.
The program will display for you the settings you select so you know what they are.
