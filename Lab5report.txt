In this lab we simulated a network using OpNet and ran some analysis on it.  We could see how download performance 
of a file from a server was affected by various other things running on the network.


If we activate all workstations, network performance will probably degrade.
It looks like it did.

If we increase the downloaded file size, the download time would go up, the TCP retransmission would go up.
The download time did go up, the TCP retransmission never showed anything.

If we increase the background load to 10Mbps, the network is not stable.
 I can't tell by what I should decrease the backgroun load by since the retransmission stat never shows anything.
